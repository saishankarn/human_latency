# human_latency

This repository contains files to store human performance for the task of counting, in any dataset. 
Clone the repository and follow the video instruction to test the human level performance on the challenging task.
In this case, we are interested in counting the number of **cars, trucks and buses** (together, class-wise split not required) per image, from the COCO Dataset.

# Annotation procedure

* Open the index.html file in your web browser
* Press **Start**, a new image appears and the timer starts. 
* Once you're done counting the number of objects in the image, press **Stop**.
* Enter the number of objects counted in the box, left to **Save**, and click **Save**.
* **Double-click Reset** to reset the timer to 00:00:00
* Continue with **Start** for the next image.
